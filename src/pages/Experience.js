                    This month, we carried out the same task as in the previous
                    week. We encoded te revocational from other association. It
                    has more than one thousand (1,000 +) planters with their net
                    cane and a total average of their LKg-Tc. I was assigned
                    also to print out of the information of new planter’s member
                    of the association. And this week there’s a planter came
                    into the office for her testing mill of the production
                    (sugarcane). That was her first delivery. We ask her name,
                    address and phone number if incase the result of the testing
                    would be out, the staff would call her for the updates of
                    her production (sugarcane). And after that we, wrote her
                    name and address in a piece of paper with the variety of the
                    production (sugarcane), then we submitted it to the Quality
                    Assessment (QA) Laboratory with her five stick of sugarcane
                    for testing. And we insert also the logo of sonedco-pa to
                    the letter head of their documents as well as the logo of
                    URC (Universal Robina Corporation).

                    During our first month of OJT (On the Job Training), I
                    experienced a lot, specially how to identify the variety of
                    the production (sugarcane). Because there was a planter came
                    into the office with her five stick of sugar cane for test
                    mill. That was my first time to know that the planter
                    allowed to have a testing mill for their sugarcane. And I
                    experienced how to create a format in Microsoft word,
                    instead using space, I could use tab for the alignment of
                    word and numbers. I was also experience by inserting the
                    logo or letter head on their documents and encoding the
                    final production crop year 2022-2023. It was a little bit
                    tired because that was more than one thousand (1,000 +)
                    planters with their net cane and LKg-Tc. But it was good for
                    me because it helps me to become better, specially to
                    enhanced my skills, interns of using keyboard.

                    This month, I carried out the same tasks, I was encoded the
                    Sugar and Molasses Final Production of the planters. We
                    we’re getting the Trucking Allowance and the other
                    Incentives Debit Memo Week 13. Then I was encoded the name
                    of the planters have a lowest lkg-tc within this week, and
                    after that we print it and submit to the Quality Assurance
                    (QA) Laboratory. Together with my co-trainee we we’re
                    getting the Distribution of all association and Planters
                    Daily Report. We also printed the template of trip ticket
                    and I was made a format of milling report. Then I print the
                    list of New registered planters of SONEDCO-PA Association
                    and I double check their name, if they already listed on the
                    other file.

                    This month, My experienced during the 9th week of On the Job
                    Training (OJT) is on how to made a format of their milling
                    report. I was tried to incorporate and printed out. I was
                    learned more how to handle the documents of the planters. I
                    already knew the process and routine inside the office, as
                    we came into the office, we already knew what we we’re going
                    to do. I realized that I should use my initiative because
                    sometimes the staff was never ask or command a task or
                    activity.

                    During our last month of OJT, the staff asked me to submit
                    the papers of the planters in other association for the
                    confirmation. The staff said if they already had feedback, I
                    have to wait for their response but the staff of that
                    association said, they want to asked or they need to verify
                    their old planters to confirm it that planter really want to
                    transfer. I was carried out same task encoding the final
                    production with sugar and molasses. But I didn’t finish
                    encoding because we are running out of time to continue and
                    that was our last day as an intern. Then in was verified the
                    report and analysis with cane milled, which were mill A and
                    mill B. And I was examined the delivery of planters, and
                    what time they are milled, and we get the trucking
                    allowances and other incentives debit memo.

                    This month, it was our last week of OJT. I see myself that I
                    can work without any supervision. I was so thankful to the
                    staff to have them to train and equip us in every aspect
                    inside the office. Throughout those experienced I will be
                    able to immediately use what I learned. And every task and
                    activities aided my learnings. I was also thankful for
                    allowing us to finish the 486 hours OJT to enable us to
                    practice and apply the skills
